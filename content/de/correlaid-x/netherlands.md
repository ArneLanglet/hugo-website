Joel graduated from his master program in political science at University of Gothenburg in summer 2018.
Currently, he lives in Utrecht and started with several other passionate data scientists a local CorrelAid chapter in the Netherlands.
We are curious if we can transfer the concept of "data for good" on another cultural context and are excited for the first local beyond Germany.

During his masters in Neuroscience, Andrew started up an NGO and tried to build an
orphanage in Kenya. Two years in, he failed and vowed to build up his skillset and
network to try to do good again once he had more experience. He has since then
worked as a data scientist at Capgemini and United Wardrobe, specializing in NLP,
Search, and Recommendation Systems. After seeing how much more impact we can
have with data, he’s switched from building orphanages to building models for good.

Eager to gain a better understanding of the human mind, Kai is about to finish his
master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Neuroscience. In combining
these fields, he seeks to get insights into fundamental cognitive mechanisms that
can help develop new medical treatments and improve existing machine learning
algorithms. He is fascinated by the idea of effective altruism and dedicated to use his
acquired skill set to help others to “do good better”.
