The Freiburg Local Chapter CorrelAid X Freiburg is currently in the start-up phase. And we are already excited about the many project proposals and ideas that we want to present and implement in the coming weeks and months.
We as volunteers are already excited to apply our interdisciplinary skills to concrete projects and to get involved in the strong civil society in Freiburg. Our work will focus on the topics of sustainability, mobility and open government, in harmony with the urban society. In addition, we want to improve applied skills in dealing with data by providing courses in methods and tools for R and Python.
If you feel like joining us, feel free to contact us directly!
Stay tuned!

As a landscape ecologist, Marco loves working with spatial data - whether it's processing, analysis or visualization. Frontend, backend ... as long as the question fits, he is easily inspired for essentially everything.
