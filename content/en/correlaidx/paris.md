The CorrelAid and Data for Good network is growing and we started to establish a local chapter in Paris. With its vibrant Tech scene, international crowd, tons of research institutes and of course being the center of the French NGO landscape, Paris offers a lot of possibilities to become active.

At the moment we do not have regular meetings yet, but we organize events (like the [Open Data Day](https://opendataday.org/)), and projects, often in collaboration with other local or international organizations (e.g. with the citizen science community [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) or the [City Interaction Lab](https://sites.google.com/cri-paris.org/cityinteractionlab/home)).

You can meet us online or at the [Learning Planet Institute](https://www.learningplanetinstitute.org/en) (former Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity). Our research interests and competencies are situated in citizen science, network science, open science and human computer interaction, but we are interested in and open to all kinds of data-for-good experiments!

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in CorrelAid Paris, so we can get in touch!
