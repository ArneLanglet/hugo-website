In addition to BVB, beer and its own german Tatort series, Dortmund also has a statistics faculty and its own data science program.
In February 2018, the Local Chapter Dortmund was founded and a lot was set in motion with a kick-off meeting, workshops and initial project ideas. Since then, however, it has become a bit quieter.
Now, we want to revive the chapter. We don't want to limit ourselves to Dortmund, but want to build up a chapter for the whole Ruhr area. If you want to join or get in contact with us, write an email to [dortmund@correlaid.org](mailto:dortmund@correlaid.org)

Already during his physics studies, Fabian was fascinated by the possibilities of machine learning in data analysis. Since his PhD in 2016, he has been working in the research department of a data science company. After joining CorrelAid in 2021, he wants to revive the Local Chapter Dortmund/Ruhr area and is looking forward to the opportunity to use Data Science for a better world with like-minded people.
