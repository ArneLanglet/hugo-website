Jan, master student at Copenhagen Business School. 
During my bachelors degree, I became interested in data analysis and since then I'm supporting CorrelAid.When I'm not busy with CorrelAid (morning, noon & night) you can usually find me in the bar down the street.

Johannes had the idea to found CorrelAid in 2015 and head of the association ever since. 
I study "Evidence-based Policymaking" at the University of Oxford and Policy-Analysis at Universit√§t Konstanz. I'm especially interested in evaluation methods, using evidence and data for society and politics and social entrepreneurship.
