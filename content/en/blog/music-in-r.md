_The programming language R is widely used in the academic world, and, increasingly, in data journalism, too. People run analyses, plot their data and calculate predictions of real world phenomena. But R can do more than that – things that many people don’t even know about: making presentations, writing books, and so on. We start a new, loose series about the crazy stuff you can do in R apart from science. Today, Jochen of the Mannheim local chapter starts with explaining you how to make R play music._

R is, and I cannot state this enough, an incredibly versatile tool. Back at the University of Konstanz, where my experience with R took root, one of my professors once coined the phrase "Using R, it is never a question if you can do something. The only question is how."

Now, roughly 3 years later on a rainy afternoon in Mannheim, this pretty accurate description of R's power came back to my mind: It was the birthday of a good friend of mine and I had been recking my brain all day long over the question how to congratulate him in a way more imaginative than the ususal text messages. With him being a Statistician and me being a wannabe Data Scientist, I thought: "Why not write an R-Script that plays Happy Birthday?". Armed with a copy of RStudio and supported by the tremendous swarm intelligence of the internet, the only question remaining was: How?
