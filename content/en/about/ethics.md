# Ethical Guidelines

## Code of ethics

CorrelAid is an independent and inclusive non-partisan network. Our projects are aimed at supporting non-profit organisations in expanding their impact by enabling them to actively participate in the digital world.

We try to keep entry barriers as low as possible and provide the volunteers in our network with diverse opportunities of getting involved - Allowing them to find one that fits their lives.

When deciding on partners to cooperate with, our ethics commission will place great emphasis on the organisation's dedication to [our values]({{< ref "/about#our-values" >}}), its commitment to social good and the benefit for society resulting from a potential project. 


## Ethics commission

The ethics commission is a working group of the association CorrelAid e.V. It reviews the association's activities with regard to general ethical values and becomes active upon request. The ethics commission will then examine the request and issue a written statement on its ethical aspects, stating whether / under which circumstances it is in line with CorrelAid's ethical standards. 

**The ethics commission will be appointed for the first time in March 2022 at an extraordinary general assembly of CorrelAid e.V.** 

An unoffical English translation of the rules of procedures of the ethics commission can be viewed [here](/material/correlaid_ev/2021-12-17_ethikkommission_rules_of_procedure_en.pdf). The German original can be found [here](/material/correlaid_ev/2021-12-17_ethikkommission_geschaeftsordnung.pdf).
