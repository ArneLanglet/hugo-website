## Data Volunteering

In our volunteering projects, we connect non-profit organisations with a team of volunteer data analysts from our network. Together, we will support NPOs in optimising their processes, discovering new insights and working towards a more efficient allocation of resources. In general, projects run from 2 to 4 months. 

When setting up the teams, diversity plays an important role. This allows us to gather all relevant skills required for a project, while at the same time providing a unique and valuable learning opportunity for all people involved in the project.

    It was a very, very positive experience for us. It was amazing insight that CorrelAid brought and was super practical. On our limited budget, we would never have 
    been able to afford this. I think what the group does is outstanding. There should be more like this.

    What I enjoyed most, was publishing a new version of our dashboard. Usually, this happened on Sunday evenings, 
    after a weekend of programming and implementing new ideas. I've learned a lot from my teammates and our partners 
    at GoVolunteer during the project: Not only did I improve my coding skills in R, but I also learned how to do 
    effective project work in a vivid virtual team.

    The cooperation with CorrelAid gave us fascinating insights into what is possible with data analysis.
