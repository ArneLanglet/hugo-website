## Data Consultancy

In our projects, we connect non-profit organisations with a team of volunteer data analysts from our network. Together, we will support NPOs in optimising their processes, discovering new insights and working towards a more efficient allocation of resources. In general, projects run from 2 to 4 months. 

When setting up the teams, diversity plays an important role. This allows us to gather all relevant skills required for a project, while at the same time providing a unique and valuable learning opportunity for all people involved in the project.

    The cooperation with CorrelAid gave us fascinating insights into what is possible with data analysis.
