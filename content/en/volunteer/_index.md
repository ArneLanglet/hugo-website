# Volunteering at CorrelAid

Our network provides different possibilities to network and get active for Data4Good. Our activities and offers are open to everyone as long as they behave in line with our [Code of Conduct](/en/about/codeofconduct/). If you want to support CorrelAid beyond volunteering with us, you can also [become a member](/en/become-member/) of the registered assocation CorrelAid e.V.. 

Want to learn more about the way we work and our principles? Check out the section below or take a look at our [Hitchhiker's Guide to CorrelAid](https://docs.correlaid.org/wiki/hitchhikers-guide). Our regular newsletter is the best way to stay up to date about offers and activities within CorrelAid.
