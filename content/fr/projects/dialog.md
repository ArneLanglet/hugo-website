## Dialogue

We have the vision of establishing an open dialogue between the civic society and the data science community: Such a dialogue could be used to develop new ideas on how to use data science for social good. This is why we came up with the concept of the "Data Dialogue". During such an event, three to five non-profit organisations will have the opportunity to meet, discuss and connect with around 20 data scientists. By doing so, both sides can obtain a more in-depth impression of each other and gauge which relevant data is already present at the NPO and how it can be used to support the organisation's goals.
